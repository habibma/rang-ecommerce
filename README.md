# Rang eCommerce
This Project is a soll website development practice using React and Sass

## Aproach
This mini-solo project is significant because I used:
- Postman software to go through data received from API;
- Context for passing states down to components without props drilling;
- reusable components to make my codes more consistent, scalable, and maintainable;
- Firebase for user authentication in sign-in and sign-up stages;
- Grid and Flow display types are Sass to make the website more accessible over different devices.
